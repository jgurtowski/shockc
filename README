Dependencies:
  libcurl - usually already installed on most machines

1. Setup Environment:
 An environment script shock_env.sh is in the root directory of the project.
 Edit this file and add your shock username, password as well as the 
 url for the shock server you want to interact with.
 Now source the shock_env.sh to export the proper environment variables.
 
   $>source shock_env.sh


2. Build Client:
  Execute the make command in the root of the project
      
    $>make

  A binary shockc should be created, run it without parameters to view help.
  In addition to the shockc binary, a libshockc.so library is also built.
  This library can be helpful if you need programmatic access to shock.

libshockc:
  Documentation is sparse. Take a look at shock_connection.h most of the
  action takes place there. Also look at the main.c file to see how
  the library is used.
